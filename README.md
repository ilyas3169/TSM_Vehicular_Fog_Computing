# %%%% Steps to execute the simulation and achieve the results as depicted in the article.... 
For more flexibility in the inputs, more updates can be shared at a later stage....Or the reader can edit for himself / herself...The current version of simulation code comprises of the following main steps supported by MATLAB source data files (.mat format) and MATLAB code files (.m format)....
## Step 1: Generation and displaying the curve of the 'TSM' approach and the first step of the Monte Carlo Simulation, that is placing random samples above and below the curve of 'TSM' approach...
The Matlab data code and Matlab file used for the are: 
### ***MATLAB data source file-1: Covered_Areas_TSM_RR_BCQI_PF13January2024 and *** 
### ***MATLAB code/simulation file-1: RunningTSMSchedueler10january2023*** 

## Step 2: Generate the covered areas of 'TSM' approach and all other approaches using the MATLAB data (.mat format) and source file (.m format). These MATLAB files are:
### ***MATLAB data source file-1: Covered_Areas_TSM_RR_BCQI_PF13January2024*** and
### ***MATLAB source file : Plotting_Covered_Areas_all_methods_11January2024***. 
Kindly note that the MATLAB source data file (.mat format) here in this case is ***MATLAB data source file-1: Covered_Areas_TSM_RR_BCQI_PF13January2024*** as mentioned already in ***step-1***. And, we assume here that you have loaded this MATLAB source data file (.mat format) before executing the ***m*** files mentioned in ***this step*** and ***step-1***.

## Step 3: Plot the run time of the 'TSM' approach and other benchmark methods using and loading MATLAB data source file (.mat format) and MATLAB code file (.m format). These MATLAB files are:
### *** the MATLAB source data file (.mat format): RUNTime_TSM_BestCQI_PF_RR_19May2023***  and 
### executable the MATLAB source/code file (.m format) : Runtime_BCQI_RR_PF_TSM_19May2023***
